Open source software to demonstrate robot fish built in
Tallinn University of Technology Centre for Biorobotics
as part of FILOSE (FIsh LOcomotion and SEnsing) project.

To compile, you need:
AForge.NET Framework (tested version 2.2.4.1)
Kinect for Windows SDK v1.5 (earlier code requires beta2)
Microsoft Expression blend SDK for .NET 4 (for full screen support)
WPF Toolkit (tested version 3.5.50211.1)
Microsoft Visual C# 2010 (tested Visual Studio Express and Ultimate)

Serial port drivers for fish and fans:
PL-2303 USB-to-Serial
Silicon Laboratories CP210x VCP Drivers

Kinect requires Windows 7 or later versions and requires a good USB 2.0 hub to itself.
Plug serial port converters to other hubs.
